    <h1> Barbados </h1>
    <div>
        <h3>Barbados is a beautiful island nation in the southeastern Caribbean. It is known for its white sandy beaches, 
        rich culture, and warm hospitality.
        </h3>
        <h4>The island is also proud of its strong leadership, including Prime Minister Mia Mottley, a respected global advocate 
        for climate action. Barbados has made its mark on the world not only through leadership, but also through culture
         and music, most notably as the birthplace on international superstar Rihanna.
